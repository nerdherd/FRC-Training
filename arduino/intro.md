# Introduction to Arduino
### What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is an electronic prototyping platform. It is a small programable board with limitless applications -- we use Arduinos for everything from reading data from sensors to making our driver station light up. These lessons will cover the fundamentals of Arduino programming and basic electrical design. 
### Arduino Types
There are many different kinds of Arduinos, but the one you will encounter most often is the Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno and similar boards operate at 5V. There are 14 digital pins available (6 of which can provide a PWM output signal). It is worth mentioning that since Arduino is an open-source platform, many clones exist, but they are all essentially the same -- the Sparkfun Redboard, for instance, is just like the Arduino Uno and can be programmed the same way, albeit with a different USB cable. 
### Getting Started
To start programming with Arduino, you will need the appropiate [software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Download the correct version and install the IDE on your computer. You will also need a USB cable to program your Arduino (the type of cable will depend on the type of Arduino you have).
