# Introduction to Java
Java is an object oriented programming language that has a huge range of applications. It is used to program the robot. These lessons will cover the basics of programming in Java, while applications and things specific to FRC will be covered in a separate lesson.

### Data Types
Before starting with any programming language, it is helpful to understand each data type. Below are all of the datatypes you will use when programming the robot.
- `boolean` (8 bit): Either true or false.
- `int`	    (32 bit): Signed integer. (Signed means that it can be negative or positive)
- `float`   (32 bit): Signed floating point number (decimal).
- `double`  (64 bit): Double precision floating point number. Used very frequently in FRC.

### The Basics
Java is written in plain text `.java` files and compiled into `.class` files by `javac`. The `.class` files that are created contain bytecodes -- instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you run a java application, it runs with an instance of the JVM. The Java environment in which this application runs is called the java platform and consists of the JVM and the Java Application Programming Interface (API). The API is essentially a collection of useful software that developers have access to.

Java is a widespread programming language because it is cross-platform and easy to use. Additionally, a huge number of libraries/appropiate documentation already exist for Java, making integrating common features trivial.  

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE is a piece of software that you will write all of your code in. There are many Java IDEs available, but the one used for Team 687 is called Eclipse. Eclipse is available for OSX, Windows, and Linux. It provides many useful tools such as git integration and FRC plugins that generate starter templates. A link to Eclipse is provided below.
