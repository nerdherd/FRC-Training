# Introduction to Robot Programming

### What is Robot Programming?
Robot programming is an interface for the drivers to control the robot. Although invisible and intangible, software is one of the most important parts of the robot. As I like to say, "Good software can make a bad robot win but bad software will make a good robot loose".

### Game Structure
Most FRC games are structured into two different periods: a 15 second autonomous period and a 2 minute and 15 second teleoperated period. During the autonomous period, robots act on their own as the drivers must stay clear of the driver station. During the teleoperated period, the drivers step forward and take the controls to direct their robots to victory.
